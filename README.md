# DubzHud for Minecraft #

## Introduction ##
DubzHud is a Forge mod for Minecraft that changes how HUD components render. Currently it replaces the health and hunger bars with partially transparent, centralized bars with a numerical value rendered overtop. It also displays swing cooldown and tool durability.


## Installation ##
[DubzHud Releases Page](https://github.com/RedPanda4552/DubzHud/releases)

DubzHud is a Forge mod, and therefore requires you have Forge installed. Don't have Forge installed? Head over to the [Minecraft Forge Files page](http://files.minecraftforge.net) and pick the installer that matches the Minecraft version you have.

### Picking the right file from Forge ###
Mods usually will want Forge to be for the same version of Minecraft. Currently, DubzHud may not work well across multiple Minecraft versions so you should make sure your Forge build is for the same version of Minecraft as DubzHud.

### Installing DubzHud Into Forge ###
After running your Forge client for the first time, a "mods" folder will appear in your .minecraft folder. DubzHud can simply be dropped in and provided the version of DubzHud you are using was built for the version of Minecraft you are using, DubzHud should load nicely when you start your game.

#### Finding the .minecraft Folder ####
##### Windows #####
Open a run box by holding your Windows key and hitting R. Type "%appdata%" and hit enter. A new window will pop up and .minecraft will be at the top.

##### Linux #####
The .minecraft folder should appear in your home folder. It will be hidden by default, but if you show hidden files in your file browser it should show up.
