DubzHud for Minecraft

DubzHud is a Forge mod for Minecraft that adds HUD components for convenience. HUD components are categorized into two types: Modules and Notifications.

Modules
DubzHud displays Modules in a line across the top of the screen. Modules can be reordered or removed by manually changing the DubzHud configuration file (.minecraft/config/dubzhud.cfg). Modules include: FPS, TPS (estimated), light levels (sky light and block light), entity count (rendered and loaded), coordinates, and world time.

Notifications
DubzHud displays Notifications under the Modules line. Currently, 5 notifications are implemented: melee strength indicator, and a low durability indicator for each armor piece. The melee strength Notification may be turned off in the config file, and its colors can be changed as well.
